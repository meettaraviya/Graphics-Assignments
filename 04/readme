REPORT
We made a non-humanoid model similar to minecraft models using their
basic dimensions and structures.We also used their texture mapping to
create uv mapping for all the raw files basically adding a boolean bit to
indicate whether the texture is enabled is enabled in that part or not i.e, if
the bit is 0,no texture mapping is done, if 1 then mapping is done and
specific values between 0 and 1 are written to it.

We made a humanoid model of spongebog squarepants. Not detailed due to lack of time.

However there is some error, so both texture and colours are not working together.
Please comment out lines 12,14,15,16 of shaders/fshader.glsl, while testing the non humanoid model robot.char. Model can be toggled using appropriately commenting 116 and 117 of main.cpp. Sorry for inconvenience, but there was a lack of time.


To rotate i-th part in the key, press key i along with one of R/F/T/G/Y/H:

1. 0+(R-F),(T-G),(Y-H)
2. 1+(R-F),(T-G),(Y-H)
3. 2+(R-F),(T-G),(Y-H)
4. 3+(R-F),(T-G),(Y-H)
5. 4+(R-F),(T-G),(Y-H)
6. 5+(R-F),(T-G),(Y-H)
